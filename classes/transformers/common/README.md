# README.md â€” App/transformers/common

This directory contains all transformer-related classes used across the IRTF
application, grouped into:

 - Utility Classes (e.g., LabelUtility, InstrumentUtility)
 - A unified API wrapper class (TransformerCore)
 - Trait files that segment TransformerCore by utility category

---

## TRAIT SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The `TransformerCore` class provides a consolidated API surface for all transformer
operations. To reduce file size and improve maintainability, its methods are
grouped into traits. Each trait wraps the corresponding utility class.

For example:
- Methods wrapping `LabelUtility` live in `LabelTrait`
- Methods wrapping `TInstrumentUtility` live in `InstrumentTrait`

These traits are then composed into `TransformerCore` via `use` statements.

---

## DEVELOPMENT NOTE

If you add a new method to any *Utility class*, you MUST also add a corresponding
wrapper method to the appropriate TransformerCore *XXXTrait* file.

This ensures that the `TransformerCore` class stays up-to-date and provides
a stable, consistent interface for all transformer operations across the system.

---

## MAINTAINED TRAITS (as of current refactor):

- LabelTrait
- InstrumentTrait
